    <h1>Tag in HTML:</h1>
    <p>A tag is a set of characters constituting a formatted command for a web page. At the core of HTML, tags provide the directions or recipes for the visual content that one sees on the Web. An element, on the other hand, is a part of a web page that is marked up by start and end tags along with the content included inside.</p>

    <h1>Doctype Declaration in HTML:</h1>
<p>The <'!DOCTYPE html'> declaration is used to inform the web browser about the version of HTML in which the page is written. It is not a tag; rather, it provides instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is using, and it must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <'html'> tag.</p>
